# Embuted Systems Project- Traffic light Simulator 

This Project consists of an implementation of a system capble of control the traffic lights in order to reduce queues sizes and time on queues.
For the implementation of the system we use 3 different systems: Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Android and also the integration between this 3 that corresponds to the 4 system(InterGitDoc).

# Requirements for the Project:

- The system has to have at least one crossing, with pedestrian lights in at least one street
- The cars should not wait more than 15 sec on a red light
- The system should detect congestion (more than 10 cars stopped at a light) in less than 2 sec
- Queues with 10 or more cars should not have the red light on for more than 10 sec

# How to run the project
